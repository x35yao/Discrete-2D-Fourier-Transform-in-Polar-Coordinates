# Discrete 2D Fourier Transform in Polar Coordinates
## Abstract
The discrete Fourier transform in Cartesian coordinates has proved to be invaluable in
many disciplines. However, less theory has been developed for functions that are best
described in polar coordinates. In this thesis, a new discrete 2D-Fourier transform in
polar coordinates is proposed and tested by numerical simulations with respect to
accuracy and precision. Guidelines of choosing sample size are developed.
Furthermore, to be as useful as its Cartesian counterpart, improvements are made to
reduce the computing time.
